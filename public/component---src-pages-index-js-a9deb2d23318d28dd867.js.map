We were provided with various starter datasets, and my group and I scraped data from\\\n        the Foursquare API to measure venue popularity by the number of visits. We also gathered data for the\\\n        London Underground in order to represent the subway network as a graph and calculate the eigenvalue\\\n        centrality (page rank) of each station, and we engineered a few other features which were inspired by\\\n        the literature we read while researching.
