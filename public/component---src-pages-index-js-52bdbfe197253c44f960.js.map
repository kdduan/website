We envisioned a resource that could unify online courses present in Coursera, Udemy, and edX so that users could log a course they've taken from any of these platforms and get a recommendation for which course to take next. The MVP is nearly complete, and we are building the app with React, Flask, and Firebase. We built the recommender system with Python and utilized the NLTK library in order to create an algorithm that would recommend courses based on word intersection between courses in the database and courses that the user has logged as taken.\",\n        idx: 2\n      },\n      {\n        title: 'Predicting Olympic Impact on Local Businesses (Citadel Datathon)',\n        desc: \"For the 2020 Citadel Datathon, teams were tasked with analyzing the socioeconomic impact that the Olympics have on host cities. My team and I decided to take a more microecnomic approach and see if we could predict how local businesses would be impacted by the Olympics. From the papers we read, there was surprisingly little research on this topic. We felt that a predictive model for business popularity would have great utility for local business owners as they could adjust to the Olympics more effectively. We were provided with various starter datasets, and my group and I scraped data from the Foursquare API to measure venue popularity by the number of visits. We also gathered data for the London Underground in order to represent the subway network as a graph and calculate the eigenvalue centrality (page rank) of each station, and we engineered a few other features which were inspired by the literature we read while researching. In the end we managed to create a soft-voting classifier using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers that achieved a 0.69 AUC score.\",\n        idx: 3\n      },\n      {\n        title: 'Triangle Pattern Convolutional Neural Network',\n        desc: 'This project was inspired by my work as an intern at the SEC.
